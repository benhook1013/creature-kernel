# Architecture documentation

Status: Provisional architecture baseline

This directory owns Creature Kernel's target technical boundaries, data flow,
invariants, and component responsibilities. Normative serialized formats and
semantic vocabularies belong in [`spec/`](../../spec/).

## Documents

- [System overview](system-overview.md)
- [Execution model](execution-model.md)
- [Component responsibilities](component-responsibilities.md)
- [Repository structure](repository-structure.md)
- [Decision records](../decisions/README.md)

## Architectural authority

- Product requirements define the outcomes architecture must satisfy.
- Specifications define the contracts architecture consumes and produces.
- Architecture defines target responsibilities and invariants.
- Decision records explain consequential choices and identify canonical documents
  to update.
- Research and experiments provide evidence but are not automatically normative.
- Implementation may lag architecture; project tracking must report that gap.

Architecture documents must label unresolved areas rather than presenting a
plausible proposal as an accepted contract. The current content is a proposed,
assistant-synthesized target pending review; it is not an accepted architecture
baseline.

## Current maturity

The architecture is pre-implementation. Component names describe provisional
responsibility boundaries, not approved packages, processes, repositories, or
technologies.

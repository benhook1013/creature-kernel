# Current operational handover

Snapshot: 2026-08-23 NZST

This is a concise operational handoff for continuing the current runway in the
Codex app. It is not a new authority owner: `docs/project/status.md` remains
the canonical owner of the active runway, and the required reading order in
`AGENTS.md` still applies.

## Where to continue

- Primary checkout: `/home/ben/src/creature-kernel` — clean, synchronized
  `main` at `f30bdb2` / `origin/main`.
- Active worktree: `/home/ben/src/creature-kernel-worktrees/authored-form-expressivity`
  — branch `implementation/authored-form-expressivity`, created from
  `f30bdb2` for bounded work toward the next named checkpoint.
- [PR #103](https://github.com/benhook1013/creature-kernel/pull/103)
  merged at `f30bdb2` after all three required CI checks passed. Its merge
  retains useful plumbing and comparison evidence; it does not accept the
  disposable surface as a form-quality success.

Open the active worktree in the Codex app to continue the runway.
Read `AGENTS.md` in the required order, then this handover and the linked
[current status](status.md).

## Gallery and service

- Gallery: [successor surface checkpoint](http://localhost:8765/review/successor-surface-checkpoint)
- Persistent root: `/home/ben/.cache/creature-kernel/visual-reviews`
- The checkpoint contains `review.json` and exactly 8 PNGs; it has no
  `response.json` as of this handover.
- User service:
  `/home/ben/.config/systemd/user/creature-kernel-visual-review.service`.
  It is enabled and active on port 8765 and serves LAN read-only.

Useful local checks:

```bash
systemctl --user status creature-kernel-visual-review.service
systemctl --user restart creature-kernel-visual-review.service
```

Because LAN mode is read-only, capture Ben's visual feedback in chat or project
docs; do not expect the gallery to create `response.json`.

## PR #103 disposition and next checkpoint

Ben's current appraisal is that the v6 disposable successor demonstrates
deterministic connected whole-body generation and plumbing across variants,
but does not demonstrate convincing complex skin/form expressivity. No further
aesthetic polishing of this disposable consumer is planned.
In the project's 2026-08-22 Codex chat, Ben said the goals-and-roadmap write-up
"sounds good" and that "your next visual checkpoint also sounds good," then
instructed, "also we have agreed on your goals roadmap discussion and next
visual checkpoint, ensure that info is baked into repo now too." This approves
the direction to stop aesthetic polishing of this disposable consumer and
prepare the next authored-form expressivity gallery; it did not by itself
authorize the merge.

On 2026-08-23 Ben said, "i dont care about 103 do what you want," delegating
PR #103's disposition to the main thread. The main thread selects merge after
the required review and checks because the branch retains useful deterministic
generation, publication, and comparison plumbing as a bounded baseline. This
authorization supersedes the earlier merge hold; it does not turn the
disposable surface into a successful form-quality proof.

Ben's exact feedback on the displayed PR #103 successor artifact was: "its got
pointy bulges under the arms again." This remains an artifact-scoped rejection;
no form-quality approval is implied. The bounded response is the
shared v6 successor-generator selection of exactly one distal `deltoid-sweep`
span (index `1`) per side, with anterior/posterior supports retained only as
guide metadata. Fixture-specific tuning, guide derivation, sampling, and
smooth-union parameters remain unchanged.

The regenerated v6 gallery was the served candidate. Its four baseline
PNGs are byte-identical to the rejected gallery and all four successor PNGs
changed. One independent static-capture trial judged the reported lobes
removed; a second still saw a smaller angular root contour. Follow-up isolation
showed that removing the distal deltoid span did not remove that contour, while
removing the temporary upper-arm bridge produced a visibly thinner attachment.
The bounded v6 correction and its evidence are retained as the basis for Ben's
appraisal above, not as a claim of form-quality approval.

The next named human checkpoint is an authored-form expressivity gallery:
richer source-authored dimensions, landmarks, and profiles drive shared
region-appropriate generator operations across all four fixed variants, with
source provenance and reproducible evidence. Representative torso, head/neck,
shoulder/arm, pelvis/leg, and digitigrade foot transitions must read as
controlled continuous skin rather than joined procedural masses. Do not use
per-variant or per-fixture patches or a handcrafted base mesh. This remains a
bounded exploratory expressivity checkpoint, not proof of a finished
morphology family or production surface system.

Routine implementation, tests, reviews, and small internal PRs may proceed
autonomously toward the checkpoint. Stop before the first genuinely appraisable
result or any retained-human/material detour. Rigging, contact, deformation, VR
integration, and permanent backend selection remain outside this immediate
runway.

## Evidence and limits

The v6 local validation passed 38 successor geometry/render tests, 16 focused
publication tests, documentation validation, and `git diff --check`. The live
gallery publication contains exactly eight images, reports the v6 successor
region for all four variants, and returns HTTP 200. A fresh code/contract review
found two publication-validation issues; both were fixed with negative tests.
All three final-head CI checks passed before merge. The earlier
viewer-navigation browser trial remains applicable because v6 changes the
captured assets rather than the viewer interaction.

# Repository evolution ledger

Status: Operational under Accepted DR-0001 Revision 5

This ledger records which structural capabilities exist now and which activate
only after concrete triggers. It prevents empty scaffolding from being mistaken
for approved design. Its active entries mean the structure exists or is used
under the accepted DR-0001 Revision 5 governance process; they do not accept
any product, specification, or architecture proposal.

States: `active`, `planned`, `triggered`, `deferred`, `not-applicable`, `retired`.

| Contribution guide | Next | planned | External collaborator or public repo | `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Contributor dry run |
| License | Next | planned | Before external contribution/distribution | Root license file | Legal review as appropriate |
| Host-engine adapter docs | Next | planned | First adapter DR accepted | Architecture and implementation area | Adapter smoke tests |
| Implementation/proof tracker | Next | planned | First meaningful code/design gap | `docs/project/implementation-tracking/` | Anchor checks |

| Advanced governance provenance | Later | deferred | Simple registry cannot answer ownership/review | Future validation | Demonstrated need |

## Change rule

Changing a state or trigger updates this ledger. Activating a consequential new
contract area may require a DR. Existing top-level policy READMEs do not
activate planned subdirectories or documents; planned destinations remain
uncreated until their activation trigger and state are met. Removing or
retiring an area must preserve any historical decisions or evidence it owns.
